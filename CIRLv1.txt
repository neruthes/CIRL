        license.

4. Obligations of the Receiver

    4(a). Electronic System: The receiver may manage the information
        in an electronic system, as long as the receiver does not

        third-party applications, which have network communication
        capabilities, to access the local database on a private
        machine).

    4(b). Proper Destruction: When the receiver would like to abandon
        a physical representation of the contact information, the
        receiver shall properly destroy the material in order to
        prevent others from retrieving the information after the
        abandonment.

    4(c). Confidentiality: The receiver shall not share the contact
        information to any third party, unless otherwise permitted by

    4(e). Sharing

        4(e)(1). If the giver is the PTC, the receiver is allowed to
            share the contact information with others, as long as
            this license is attached and they abide to this license.

        4(e)(2). If the giver is someone who received the contact
            information of the PTC under this license instead of the
            PTC, the receiver is not allowed to share the contact
            information.

5. Jurisdiction and Governance

    5(a). In the event that the receiver fails to comply with the
        license, the failure may be considered a GDPR incident.

    5(b). The receiver must comply with GDPR of the European Union in
        exercising its right to preserve the contact information.
